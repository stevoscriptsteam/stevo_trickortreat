# stevo_jobgarages
## Job Garages! 🚗🏢
Job-based garages and vehicle customisation.

Easy to configure, allowing you to completely customise where your garage menu is placed, where your customisation points can be accessed and where the vehicle spawns on selection. You can also break the garage up into separate categories, locking vehicles behind ranks and roles too. Simple design allows for ease of access by all players.
