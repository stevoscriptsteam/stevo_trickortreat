## Trick or Treating! :ghost:
Trick or Treating with some fun little tricks...

Bring Halloween to life on your FiveM server with our **Trick or Treating** resource! It allows players to trick-or-treat at various houses, with a twist: sometimes they get treats, and other times, they get a spooky trick! Players can sell their gathered candy to a mysterious Candy Clown who lurks around Los Santos...

## Features:

### Knock on Doors
 Players can knock on specific houses to receive treats or face a surprise attack by a spooky ped.
<br>
### Random Tricks
Some interactions spawn a ped with a weapon that will chase and attack, adding an extra thrill.

### Candy Selling
Players can trade collected candy with the Candy Clown for in-game money. The Clown and their van create an eerie setting that enhances the Halloween vibe.
